# Big Data Analysis in Particle Physics

### Exploration and Visualization for LHC
This lab covered a large variety of topics, from analyzing [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) data to using statistical methods for filtering out bad signals to a certain significance.

This first part has us explore and visualize LHC data (contains 2 parts) and state our observations from the visualizations. The code and notebook can be viewed by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pratsingh/Big-Data-Particle-Physics/blob/master/notebooks/Lab5.ipynb).

### Big Data with High Dimensionality
The second second part utilizes statistical analysis to differntiate between "good" data and the "bad" outliers/noisy data. The dataset was quite big and multidimensional; it had over 26 million rows and 14 features. We performed dimensionality reduction, researched featured, and limited the significance of noisy events. The end result was not perfect due to the nature of the data and compute power/time available but it proved to be a valuable lesson in how to work with big and complex data.
