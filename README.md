# Big Data Analysis in Particle Physics
This lab covered a large variety of topics, from analyzing [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) data to using statistical methods for filtering out bad signals to a certain significance.
### Exploration and Visualization for LHC
Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy

This first part has us explore and visualize LHC data (contains 2 parts) and state our observations from the visualizations. This part of the lab provided insights in how we can use visualization to do exploratory data analysis. This was particularly helpful as it gets us familiar with the dataset and enables quick observations.

### Big Data with High Dimensionality
Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, pickle, seaborn

The second second part utilizes statistical analysis to differntiate between "good" data and the outliers/noisy data. The dataset was quite big and multidimensional; it had over 26 million rows and 14 features. We performed dimensionality reduction, researched features, and limited the significance of noisy events. The end result was not perfect due to the nature of the data and compute power/time available but it proved to be a valuable lesson in how to work with big and complex data.
